This is a silly game I made as JS exercise some time ago on codepen, and I decided to update it because I stumbled upon it and thought Hey, I think I could do a better job this time.

Now, the truth of that statement remains up to debate, mostly because I still have dubious design skills and completely absent aesthetic sense (which is why I gave up the style part quickly enough and just settled on this vaguely retro futuristic my-tv-is-broken-and-this-creepy-computer-hates-me look. the initial project was waaay more ambitious than that).

But I think I did a decent job at cleaning up the JS and making it more DRY, although I ended up with 12345678543 functions... But I thinks it's more readable! I think if someone was to look at that code, someone beside me, someone who has no idea what's going on, I think they could get away with a minor headache instead of the Mother Of All Headaches that the older version would give.

I think my approach makes the code really long (and boring to write I was about to throw myself off a bridge), since you create a fraczillion different functions that all call back to the same function with a different index as argument, and I'm pretty sure that it is a very stupid method and that there is another smarter, more efficient way to do it. 
But alas, poor yorick, I have no idea what it is, so for the moment this is as good as it's gonna get.

As for the story, there is none. I jotted it down randomly as I was coding, choosing the first idea that came to me without bothering to check if it made sense or not. There is no planning, no care, no thought behind it. So don't be too harsh on it
